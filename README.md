# Deep Learning Lab — Assignment Portfolio

This repository contains my university Deep Learning Lab assignments, covering a range of fundamental to advanced topics in neural networks, computer vision, and natural language processing. The goal is not only to complete the coursework but also to make it a **learning resource for younger students** interested in applying deep learning to real-world problems.

Each assignment includes code, explanations, and references for further study.
